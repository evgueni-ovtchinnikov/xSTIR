Windows 7/Visual Studio 2013 64-bit installation steps
======================================================

Install pre-requisites
----------------------

Install Boost, SWIG and CMake GUI

Click Start -> Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> 
Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables
and add the following user variables:

Variable         Value

BOOST            Path to Boost include folder*
PYTHON           Python library name (without .lib) - look in libs sub-folder of Python folder
PYTHON_INCLUDE   Path to Python include folder
PYTHON_LIBPATH   Path to Python libs folder
SWIG_PATH        Path to swig.exe
---
*NOTE: Boost include folder is the one that contains "boost" folder, e.g.
 if your Boost root folder is C:\Boost then for Boost-1_58 it is 

   C:\Boost\include\boost-1_58

 whereas for Boost_1_59_0 it is 

   C:\Boost\boost_1_59_0

-Make sure you have "Release" in "Solution Configurations" box 
 and "x64" in "Solution Platforms"

-Click on BUILD and select "build Solution"

-Add two user variables to Windows environment variables:

Variable         Value

STIR_BUILD    Path to src folder in STIR build folder
STIR_INCLUDE  Path to STIR include folder


Build CCPPETMR C++-to-C interface utilities library
------------------------_--------------------------

-Clone iUtilities from GitHub CCPPETMR and follow the instructions in INSTALL.txt.

-Add two user variables to Windows environment variables:

Variable name      Variable value

IUTILITIES         Path to the folder where iUtilities was cloned
IUTILITIES_LIBRARY <iUtilities folder>/x64/Release/iUtilities.lib


Build C interface to STIR:
--------------------------

-Clone xSTIR from GitHub CCPPETMR

-Go to cSTIR sub-folder in xSTIR and double click on cSTIR Visual Studio Solution file

-Select "Release" in "Solution Configurations" box and "x64" in "Solution Platforms" box

-Click on BUILD and select "build Solution"

-Add user variable CSTIR_SRC containing the path to cSTIR folder to Windows environment
 variables


Build Python interface to STIR:
-------------------------------

-Go to pSTIR sub-folder and double click on pystir Visual Studio Solution file

-Select "Release" in "Solution Configurations" box and "x64" in "Solution Platforms" box

-Click on BUILD and select "build Solution"


Build Matlab interface to STIR:
-------------------------------

-Run mex_stir.m

-Add mSTIR folder to Matlab path


Cygwin/Linux installation steps (Python interface only)
=======================================================

-Install Boost, SWIG and cmake.

-Clone STIR from GitHub CCPPETMR, cd to STIR folder and run cmake (remove -fPIC flags on cygwin):

   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-fPIC -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-fPIC -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<where STIR libraries are to be built> ../

-Run make to build STIR.

-Run make install to install STIR libraries.

-Clone iUtilities from GitHub CCPPETMR and follow the instructions in INSTALL.txt.

-Clone xSTIR from GitHub CCPPETMR.

-Export the following environment  variables:

export STIR_SRC=<Path to src sub-folder of STIR folder e.g. /home/stir/devel/STIR/src>
export STIR_LIBPATH=<Path to STIR libraries folder (cf. cmake command above), e.g. /home/stir/devel/STIR/Release/lib>
export CSTIR_SRC=<Path to cSTIR sub-folder of xSTIR folder, e.g. /home/stir/devel/xSTIR/cSTIR>
export PYTHON=<Python version e.g. python2.7>
export PYINCLUDE=<Path to Python include folder, e.g. /usr/include/python2.7>
export PYLIBPATH=<Path to Python libraries, e.g. /usr/lib/python2.7/config-x86_64-linux-gnu>

Create folder <work_dir>/build/xSTIR.

-run make.
