This directory contains a few demo files that are intended
to be run interactively. For instance, for Python using spyder.

You should run them cell-by-cell, and see what commands are used
and what plots are made.

The files can be executed in one go, but the plots won't make sense
and depending on your settings, might even not appear (or immediately
disappear).

Input data sits in the EX* directories. When you run the demos,
output will be in a sub-directory called working_folder. You
can safely delete this afterwards.
